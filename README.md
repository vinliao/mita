## How to install
1. On your website's root directory, run `git submodule add https://github.com/vinliao/mita themes/mita`
2. In your `config.toml`, change the theme property to `theme = "mita"`

## How to add items in nav
Paste this to your `config.toml` and adjust accordingly.

```
[Menus]
  main = [
      {Name = "about", URL = "/about"},
      {Name = "other", URL = "/other"},
  ]
```

## Misc
- You can remove a page's date by deleting the `date` variable in the front matter. A post without date won't be listed on the front page, but still can be accessed - e.g., an about page.
